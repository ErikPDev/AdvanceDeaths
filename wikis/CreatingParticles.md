# Creating Particles

### Step 1:
- Download the `particleCreator.html` from the <a href="https://github.com/ErikPDev/AdvanceDeaths/tree/master/tools">tools folder</a>.
- Double tap the html file or open it in a web browser. Javascript is required.

### Step 2:
- After that, you can click the black color box to change it's color. You can also select Fill color to change it's background color.
- If the color of the box is white or rgb(255,255,255), then it will be rendered as invisible.

### Step 3:
- Once you've made your masterpiece, click on the `Generate` button. It will be downloaded.
- Save the JSON file to `plugin_data\AdvanceDeaths\scripts\particles`. Make sure to rename it to use it on `onDeathScript.yml`.
